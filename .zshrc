## Quote relevance:
# "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." : long nights, super long work sessions
# "A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools." : dang. that broke immediately
# "For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen." : fun with threads and async stuff. Also for recursions and loops that are supposed to stop
# "In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." : working on legacy stuff, refactoring, reviewing junior code
# "So long, and thanks for all the fish." : silly exit 0 statement, or just frick this, I'm leaving.
# "The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is… 42." : classic. It's just necessary
# "Life? Don't talk to me about life." : It's too early for this, this thing just broke for the 40th time, used when the thing currently is harder than life (rare)
# "Don't Panic." : This crap is too dang hard and I'm trying really hard not to implode right now
# "It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes." : problems that have big bugs rarely have simple answers, unfortunately
# "The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don’t." : Why the heck is this doing this???
